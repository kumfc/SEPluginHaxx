# SEPluginHaxx

*I made this thing few years ago when I was not really interested in making code beautiful, so I guess it would cause some pain to some of you.*

### What.
This is a kind of haxx I made for testing purposes. It is based on Source Engine serverside plugin interface, but works on client as well cuz thats Valve.

**What can it do:**
– Disconnect reason override
– sv_cheats & any other command bypass
– Unfinished but working aimbot
– Report any TF2 player by SteamID

**What it could do:**
– Airstuck which I removed when it got fixed
– Reset conditions exploit which faced the same final

**What can be done with that base:** Literally everything. 

### Compile Requirements
**1.** Source Engine MP2013 SDK

**2.** Few leaked Source Engine 2007 class header files

**3.** Visual Studio 2013

**4.** Microsoft Detours 3

**5?** If you want all functions to work properly, you can find up-to-date CreateMove && INetChannel::ProcessStream && INetChannel::Shutdown memory offsets for specific Source Engine game.
